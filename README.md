Return of the Jar - 7 Days to Die mod

This mod returns empty cans and jars in game. When you drink or eat you will have a empty jar or can returned to your inventory!

Original icons do not work so I have used other icons in game and changed the colour so the difference should be noticeable. This ensures the mod only needs to be on server side only.
