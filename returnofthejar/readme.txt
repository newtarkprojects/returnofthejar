This mod returns the Empty Jar and Can.

When you drink or eat, you have the jar or can returned to your inventory!

Empty Jar and Empty can will show as different icons, this is because the icons available do not work. Icons used are to ensure this mods can be used without client needing to install.

Enjoy!
